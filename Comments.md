Thought for a couple of seconds


Yes—although the **binary** WebAssembly format doesn’t include any comments, the **textual** WAT format does. There are two comment styles in WAT:

1. **Line comments**
   Start with `;;` and continue to the end of the line.

   ```wat
   ;; this is a comment
   (module
     (func $add (param $x i32) (param $y i32) (result i32)
       ;; add the two parameters
       local.get $x
       local.get $y
       i32.add))
   ```

2. **Block comments**
   Enclosed between `(;` and `;)` and may span multiple lines (they can also nest).

   ```wat
   (module
     (func $mul (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
       (; multiply a and b ;)
       local.get $a
       local.get $b
       i32.mul))
   ```

Anything inside these comment delimiters is ignored by the WAT parser and does **not** end up in the compiled `.wasm` binary.
